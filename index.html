        <p> The tradition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month (BCAM)
          began in 1985 by former First Lady Betty Ford, wife of
          President Gerald Ford. She had a mastectomy in September
          1974 following her breast cancer diagnosis, following her
          husbandâ€™s swearing in as President on August 9. It was a
          partnership established between the American Cancer
          Society and the pharmaceutical division of Imperial
          Chemical Industries.</p>

        <img src="images/Mammogram.png" alt="Mammogram">
        <p> The mission of Breast Cancer Awareness Month early on was
          to ensure that women were educated about breast cancer and
          its early detection tests. The mammogram was, and still is,
          seen as an essential tool used in fighting against the
          disease. </p>

      <div class='flexbox'>
        <img src="images/Ribbon.png" alt="Ribbon">
        <p> The pink ribbon was first recognized as the
          visual symbol for BCAM in 1992, when Estee
          Lauder cosmetics handed out 1.5 million of them.
          It has been regularly used during BCAM since then.

      <div class='flexbox'>
        <img src="images/statistics.png" alt="statistics">
        <p>The American Cancer Society (ACS) states that breast cancer
          is the second leading cause of cancer death among women,
          right behind lung cancer. ACS Cancer Facts and Figures 2020
          states that African-American females have 40% higher breast
          cancer death rates than non-Hispanic white females, despite
          similar incidence rates.

        <p>Every October, breast cancer survivors and those with breast
          cancer are celebrated and encouraged to share their stories.
          There are also fundraisers for breast cancer research and other
          related causes during the month. There is also an annual breast
          cancer walk that occurs in cities around the country during the
          month.
